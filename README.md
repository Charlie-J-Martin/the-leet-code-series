# The Leet Code Series

This repository documents my development journey through the LeetCode katas as part of the [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) roadmap. Each kata solution in this repository includes the main kata function, a set of tests, and a README file providing a description of the code, the time complexity analysis, and suggestions for alternative solutions.

#### Kata Sections
- Section 1: Arrays & Hashing



#### Kata Structure
Each kata folder follows the same structure:

```
kata/
  ├── kata.ts            # Main kata function
  ├── kata.test.ts       # Test suite for the kata function
  └── README.md          # Detailed explanation of the kata and its solutions
```

#### How to Use
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-leet-code-series.git
```
Run the tests to verify the correctness of your solution:
```
npm test
```
Refer to the README in each kata folder for a detailed description of the problem, time complexity analysis, and suggestions for alternative solutions.
